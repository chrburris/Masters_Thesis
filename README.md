# Analytic Combinatorics Applied to RNA Structures
## Master's Thesis

This work is a collaboration of the work currently being conducted at The Biocomplexity Institute at Virginia Tech in the Mathematical Biocomplexity Lab. The research of my M.S. focused primarily on analytic combinatorics--a fancy phrase for complex counting problems--arising from questions in Bioinformatics.

I sought to understand the mathematical structure behind RNA folding patterns. It is well known that folded RNA structures (termed secondary structures) play a central role in their function within the cell. However, given the cost of gathering data on folding patterns, little is known about exactly how structure and function are related. My work centered around building the mathematical framework of RNA structures in an effort to guide technology and further scientific discovery.
